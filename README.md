Hi,
This project is created to automate the APIs responsible for the different functions carried out in Jira like creating a defect, adding a comment and an attachment to the 
created defect, deleting a defect etc. REST ASSURED library is used to automate the APIs. And the APIs belong to server API and not cloud API. Also the authentication type 
used here is cookie based authentication which creates a session ID which is to be used for all the subsequent API requests made.
